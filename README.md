>Exercise using JS, HTML & CSS to build a working calculator

My calculator is working but it only does two number operations.  There are a couple of edge cases that I didn't do such as handling more than two number operations and having the result number increase by the second number (eg 2 + 3 = 5, if the user presses = again then the calculator should show 8 but it shows 7 instead).  Otherwise a working calculator to do basic math.
